Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros. 
Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.

For example, given the array  arr[1,1,0,-1,-1] there are 5 elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. 
Their ratios would be 2/5 = 0.400000, 2/5 = 0.400000 and 1/5 = 0.200000. It should be printed as:
0.400000
0.400000
0.200000

Complete the plusMinus function in the editor below. It should print out the ratio of positive, negative and zero items 
in the array, each on a separate line rounded to six decimals.
